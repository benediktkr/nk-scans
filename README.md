Daily port scans of the three North Korean IP networks. Not really sure what to do with this yet...

# Changes

17/04/2015: Added the StarGate network and added `-P0` and `-oG` on all network scans. Also moved scanning time from 06:00 (GMT+9) to 12:00 (GMT+9) in hopes of catching more interesting network clients. 
18/04/2015: Removed `-P0`, it was taking too long. 
20/04/2015: Just realized that I'm probably on a list in NK now. 

# Interesting ports

Humans like even numbers and I've found that there are several hosts listening for something on ports 10000, 20000, 30000, 50000.
